## Configuration

Once installed, a default configuration file will be created at `/etc/grafana-agent.yaml`. Before starting the agent, make sure to update this configuration file to suit you needs, consulting the [official documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/configuration/). 

## Remaining tasks

Snapcrafters ([join us](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/snapcrafters-reboot/24625)) are working to land snap install documentation and the [snapcraft.yaml](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me/blob/master/snap/snapcraft.yaml) upstream so Grafana can authoritatively publish future releases.
